# fakenewsdetector
The objective of this code is to build a fake news detection model using a Decision Tree Classifier. The model is trained on a dataset containing both true and fake news articles, and its performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and a confusion matrix

The dataset comprises two CSV files: "True.csv" containing true news articles and "Fake.csv" containing fake news articles. Each dataset includes columns like 'text' and 'label,' where 'text' contains the news content, and 'label' indicates whether the news is true (0) or fake (1). The datasets are combined to create a balanced dataset for training and testing the model.
Fake.csv (23502 fake news article)
True.csv (21417 true news article) 

The classifier used in this code is a Decision Tree classifier
